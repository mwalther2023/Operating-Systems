– Robert FrostFor a friendly visit.And plod: I go up to the stone wallBlade-end up and five feet tall,I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,No, not as there is a time talk.And shout from where I am, ‘What is it?’On all the hills I haven’t hoed,I don’t stand still and look aroundAnd slows his horse to a meaning walk,When a friend calls to me from the roadA Time to Talk
